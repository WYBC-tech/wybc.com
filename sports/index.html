<h2>History</h2>
    <p>
The Sports Department has been calling Yale Athletics events since the earliest stages of WYBC. In the 1950s, the department was calling events such as Ivy League Swim Meets hosted at the historic Kiputh Exhibition pool. Today, we continue our commitment to both inform and entertain through broadcasting. The department has called a fair amount of road games—including Yale Basketball’s historic first-ever NCAA Tournament win in 2016. In that same year, we conducted the first-ever Ivy League college golf radio broadcast. Starting in 2025, we’ve also added supplementary <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yalesportsradio/	">Instagram content</a> to our coverage.
</p>

<h2>Our Team</h2>
      We are a group of sports-interested individuals who endeavor to bring you the best Yale sports coverage we can. If you’re interested in joining our team—whether for radio broadcasts, Instagram content, or even a new kind of sports outreach—email <a href="mailto:walter@wybc.com">walter@wybc.com</a> for more information.
