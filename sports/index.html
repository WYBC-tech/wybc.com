        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              The Sports Department has been calling Yale Athletic Events since the very early stages of WYBC. In the 1950s, the Department was even calling events such as Ivy League Swim Meets hosted at the historic Payne-Whitney Gymnasium. Today, the Sports Department is still strong as it calls most Bulldog home basketball, football, and hockey games. The department calls a fair amount of road games and in 2016 sent broadcasters to Providence, RI to call Yale Basketballâ€™s historic first-ever NCAA Tournament win. Also in 2016, we conducted the first-ever Ivy League College Golf radio broadcast. Sports Department Broadcasts will be listed on the website a few days in advance and when the stream is live, the link above will take you to the stream. You can also check the programming schedule to tune in to one of our weekly Sports talkshows. Long Live Radio, Long Live Sports!            </p>
