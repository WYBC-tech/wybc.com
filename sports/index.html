  <p>The Sports department calls most Bulldog home games for basketball, football and hockey. Broadcasts will be announced a few days in advance, and the stream will be accessible on our site in the listening side-bar.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>History</h2><p>The Sports Department has been calling Yale Athletic Events since the very early stages of WYBC. In the 1950s, the Department was even calling events such as Ivy League Swim Meets hosted at the historic Payne-Whitney Gymnasium. Today, the Sports Department is still strong as it calls most Bulldog home basketball, football, and hockey games. The department calls a fair amount of road games and in 2016 sent broadcasters to Providence, RI to call Yale Basketball’s historic first-ever NCAA Tournament win. Also in 2016, we conducted the first-ever Ivy League College Golf radio broadcast and is aiming to to cover some baseball games this year. Sports Department Broadcasts will be listed on the website’s programming schedule a few days in advance and when the stream is live, there will be a link to it on the website’s home page. You can also check the programming schedule to tune in to one of our weekly Sports talkshows. Long Live Radio, Long Live Sports!</p>
